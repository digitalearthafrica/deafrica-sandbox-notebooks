    "## Background\n",
    "While crops are growing, fields may look visually similar.\n",
    "However, health or growth rates from these fields can be quite different, leading to variability and unpredictability in revenue.\n",
    "Identifying underperforming crops can have two benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability to scout for disease damage.\n",
    "* Ability to investigate poor performing fields and undertake management action such as soil testing or targeted fertilising to improve yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Earth Africa use case\n",
    "Satellite imagery can be used to measure plant health over time and identify any changes in growth patterns between otherwise similar fields.\n",
    "Sentinel-2's 20-metre resolution makes it ideal for understanding the health of large fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) describes the difference between visible and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation cover.\n",
    "This index estimates the density of green on an area of land and can be used to track the health and growth of crops as they mature.\n",
    "Comparing the NDVI of two similar planting areas will help to identify any anomalies in growth patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this example, data from Sentinel-2 is used to assess crop growing patterns over two years.\n",
    "The worked example below takes users through the code required to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a time series data cube over croplands.\n",
    "2. Select multiple areas for comparison.\n",
    "3. Create graphs to identify crop performance trends over two years.\n",
    "4. Interpret the results.\n",

    "* `lat`: The central latitude to analyse (e.g. `14.789064`).\n",
    "* `lon`: The central longitude to analyse (e.g. `-17.065202`).\n",
    "* `buffer`: The number of square degrees to load around the central latitude and longitude. For reasonable loading times, set this as `0.1` or lower.\n",
    "* `date`: The most recent date to show data for. The app will automatically load all data available for the two years prior to this date. (e.g. `'2020-08-01'` shows data from August 2018 to August 2020).\n",
