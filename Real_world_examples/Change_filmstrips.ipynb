    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how natural and human landscapes have changed through time can provide vital information about the health of local ecosystems and development of the built environment. \n",
    "For example, data on changes in the distribution of vegetation in the landscape can be used to monitor the impact of deforestation, or track the recovery of forests after habitat restoration or extreme natural events (e.g. bushfires). \n",
    "Tracking changes within urban areas can be used to monitor the growth of infrastructure such as ports and transport networks, while data on coastal changes can be vital for predicting and managing the impacts of coastal erosion or the loss of coastal wetlands (e.g. mangroves).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these examples of change can be tracked using direct on-the-ground monitoring (e.g. vegetation surveys), it can be extremely challenging and expensive to obtain a comprehensive understanding of these processes at a broader landscape scale. \n",
    "For many applications, it can also be extremely useful to obtain a record of the history of a location undergoing change. \n",
    "This typically requires historical monitoring data which is unlikely to be available for all but the most intensively monitored locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Earth Africa use case\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 30 years of satellite imagery from the [NASA/USGS Landsat program](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat) is freely available for Africa, making this a powerful resource for monitoring natural and human-driven change across the African continent.\n",
    "Because these satellites image every location over Africa regularly (approximately once every 16 days), they provide an unparalleled archive of how many of Africa's landscapes have changed through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing change from individual satellite images can be made difficult by the presence of clouds, cloud shadow, sunglint over water, and dynamic processes like changing tides along the coastline. \n",
    "By combining individual noisy images into cleaner, cloud-free \"summary\" images that cover a longer time period (e.g. one or multiple years), we can obtain a clear, consistent view of the African environment that can be compared to reveal changes in the landscape over time.\n"

    "## Description\n",
    "In this example, Digital Earth Africa Landsat data is extracted for a given time range and location, and combined using the geometric median (\"geomedian\") statistic to reveal the median or 'typical' appearance of the landscape for a series of time periods (for more information about geomedians, see the [Geomedian composites notebook](../Frequently_used_code/Generating_geomedian_composites.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For coastal applications, the analysis can be customised to select only satellite images obtained during a specific tidal range (e.g. low, average or high tide).\n",
    "\n",
    "The results for each time period are combined into a 'filmstrip' plot which visualises how the landscape has changed in appearance across time, with a 'change heatmap' panel highlighting potential areas of greatest change:\n",

    "The following cell sets important required parameters for the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `output_name`: A name that will be used to name the output filmstrip plot file\n",
    "* `time_range`: The date range to analyse (e.g. `time_range = ('1984-01-01', '2019-12-31)`)\n",
    "* `time_step`: This parameter allows us to choose the length of the time periods we want to compare (e.g. `time_step = {'years': 5}` will generate one filmstrip plot for every five years of data in the dataset; `time_step = {'months': 18}` will generate one plot for each 18 month period etc.\n",
    "Time periods are counted from the first value given in `time_range`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tide_range`: This parameter allows you to generate filmstrip plots based on specific ocean tide conditions.\n",
    "This can be valuable for analysing change consistently along the coast. \n",
    "For example, `tide_range = (0.0, 0.2)` will select only satellite images acquired at the lowest 20% of tides; `tide_range = (0.8, 1.0)` will select images from the highest 20% of tides. \n",
    "The default is `tide_range = (0.0, 1.0)` which will select all images regardless of tide.\n",
    "* `resolution`: The spatial resolution to load data. \n",
    "The default is `resolution = (-30, 30)`, which will load data at 30 m pixel resolution. \n",
    "Increasing this (e.g. to `resolution = (-100, 100)`) can be useful for loading large spatial extents.\n",
    "* `max_cloud`: This parameter allows you to exclude satellite images with excessive cloud. \n",
    "The default is `0.5`, which will keep all images with less than 50% cloud.\n",
    "* `ls7_slc_off`: Whether to include data from after the Landsat 7 SLC failure (i.e. SLC-off). \n",
    "Defaults to `False`, which removes all Landsat 7 observations after May 31 2003.\n",
    "Setting this to `True` will result in extra data, but can also introduce horizontal striping in the output filmstrip plots.\n",
    "* `size_limit`: An optional integer (in square kilometres) specifying the size limit for the data query. Queries larger than this size will receive a warning that he data query is too large (and may therefore result in memory errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**If running the notebook for the first time**, keep the default settings below. This will demonstrate how the analysis works and provide meaningful results. \n"
