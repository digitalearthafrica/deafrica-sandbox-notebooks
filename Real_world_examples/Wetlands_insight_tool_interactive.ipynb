    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wetlands International](https://africa.wetlands.org/en/wetlands/what-are-wetlands/), Africaâ€™s wetlands ecosystems are estimated to cover 131 million hectares, and include some of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems in the world. They provide a host of ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being through nutrition, water supply and purification, climate and flood regulation, coastal protection, feeding and nesting sites for animals, recreational opportunities and increasingly, tourism.  As such, the health of wetland ecosystems has been identified as an important metric for the `Sustainable Development Goals` ([6.6.1 Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time](https://www.sdg6monitoring.org/indicator-661/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Wetlands Insight Tool (WIT)` provides insights into a wetland's seasonal and interannual dynamics.WIT is a spatiotemporal summary of a wetland that combines multiple datasets derived from the Landsat archive held within DE Africa. `Fractional cover`, `WOfS`, and `Landsat surface reflectance` data are retrieved from DE Africa's ODC and combined to produce a stack plot describing the percentage of a wetland polygon as vegetation fractional cover, open water, and wet vegetation through time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `Detailed Explanation:`\n",
    "Data is retrieved for timesteps containing more than 80% cloud-free data (you can adjust this number in the code below). The code calculates the Tasselled-Cap Wetness (TCW, or just 'wetness') from surface reflectance and takes the maximum Fractional cover fraction per pixel, masking Fractional cover with TCW, and masking TCW with open water. For each pixel inside or overlapping the polygon describing the wetland, WIT calculates the dominant fractional cover type. WIT selects the largest percentage value for each pixel as the dominant fractional cover type. Fractional cover was masked using WOfS and TCW to remove areas of water and wet vegetation from areas where fractional cover is calculated. This is necessary as the fractional cover algorithm erroneously classifies water as green vegetation (PV). The resulting output is a stacked plot of open water, wet vegetation, photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil for the wetland polygon through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook will run the Wetlands Insight Tool for the area encompassed by a polygon drawn on the interactive map.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Draw a polygon using the interactive jupyter widget\n",
    "2.  Set the parameters for the Wetlands Insight Tool\n",
    "3.  Run the WIT tool, resulting in a stacked plot of fractional cover, wetness, and water\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "**To run this analysis**, run all the cells in the notebook, starting with the \"Load packages\" cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After finishing the analysis**, return to the \"Analysis parameters\" cell, modify some values (e.g. choose a different polygon or time period to analyse) and re-run the analysis.\n",
    "There are additional instructions on modifying the notebook at the end.\n",
