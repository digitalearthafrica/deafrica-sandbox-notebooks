    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wetlands International](https://africa.wetlands.org/en/wetlands/what-are-wetlands/), Africaâ€™s wetlands ecosystems are estimated to cover 131 million hectares, and include some of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems in the world. They provide a host of ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being through nutrition, water supply and purification, climate and flood regulation, coastal protection, feeding and nesting sites for animals, recreational opportunities and increasingly, tourism.  As such, the health of wetland ecosystems has been identified as an important metric for the `Sustainable Development Goals` ([6.6.1 Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time](https://www.sdg6monitoring.org/indicator-661/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Wetlands Insight Tool (WIT)` provides insights into a wetland's seasonal and interannual dynamics.WIT is a spatiotemporal summary of a wetland that combines multiple datasets derived from the Landsat archive held within DE Africa. `Fractional cover`, `WOfS`, and `Landsat surface reflectance` data are retrieved from DE Africa's ODC and combined to produce a stack plot describing the percentage of a wetland polygon as vegetation fractional cover, open water, and wet vegetation through time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook will run the Wetlands Insight Tool for the area encompassed by a polygon drawn on the interactive map.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Draw a polygon using the interactive jupyter widget\n",
    "2.  Set the parameters for the Wetlands Insight Tool\n",
    "3.  Run the WIT tool, resulting in a stacked plot of fractional cover, wetness, and water\n",
