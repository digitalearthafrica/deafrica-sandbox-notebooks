    "\n",
    "[Water Observations from Space (WOfS)](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/community-safety/flood/wofs/about-wofs) are a suite of surface water products. They are generated using the WOfS classification algorithm on Landsat 8 satellite data. There are several WOfS products available for the African continent, as listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Product Type| Description |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| WOfS Annual Summary | The ratio (%) of wet to clear observations from each calendar year|\n",
    "| WOfS All-Time Summary| The ratio (%) of wet to clear observations over all time|\n",
    "| WOFLs (WOfS Feature Layers)|WOfS slices generated per scene |\n",
    "| *WOfS Filtered Summary (Under development)* | *All-time summary checked against the confidence layer* ||\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __WOfS Annual/All-Time Summary:__ The percentage of time a pixel was classified as wet. This requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Total number of clear observations for each pixel: the number of observations that were clear (no cloud or shadow) for the selected time period. The classification algorithm then assigns these as either wet, or dry.\n",
    "    - Total number of wet observation for each pixel: the number of observations that were clear *and* wet for the selected time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WOfS Summary is calculated as the ratio of clear wet observations to total clear observations, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{WOfS Summary} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Wet Observations}}{\\text{Number of (Wet + Dry) Observations}} \\times 100 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* __WOFLs (WOfS Feature Layers):__ Individual water-classified images are called Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), and are created in a 1-to-1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water. For more information on WOFLs, see the [Applying WOfS bitmasking](../Frequently_used_code/Applying_WOfS_bitmasking.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __WOfS Filtered Summary:__ The percentage of time a pixel was classified as wet, filtered using the confidence layer. The Filtered Summary is the WOfS Summary where areas with less than 10% confidence have been removed. This product is still under development for the African continent."
