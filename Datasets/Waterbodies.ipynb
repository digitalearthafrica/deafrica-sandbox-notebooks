    "## Background\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa continental Waterbodies Monitoring Service identifies more than 600,000 water bodies from over three decades of satellite observations. This service maps persistent and seasonal water bodies and the change in their water surface area over time. Mapped water bodies may include, but are not limited to, lakes, ponds, man-made reservoirs, wetlands, and segments of some river systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a local, regional, and continental scale, this service helps improve our understanding of surface water dynamics and water availability and can be used for monitoring water bodies such as wetlands, lakes and dams in remote and/or inaccessible locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service offers two products\n",
    "\n",
    "* The DE Africa Waterbodies Historical Extent\n",
    "* The DE Africa Waterbodies Surface Area Change\n",
    "\n",
    "The DE Africa Waterbodies Historical Extent product is a static polygon-based view of the DE Africa Water Observations from Space All-Time Summary product. The historical extent represents where water has appeared in at least 5% of clear observations since 1987. It is not a capture of a water body’s true extent in any given year, but a record of where water has appeared since 1987. To be captured in the dataset, polygons must have an area of at least 4,500 metres squared (5 Landsat pixels). The historical extent polygons have been derived from the [DE Africa Water Observations from Space All-Time Summary](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Landsat_WOfS_specs.html#WOfS-All-Time-Summary) product, which provides historical surface water observations across the African continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each water body, the Surface Area Change product provides the percentage of the historical extent that was classified as wet, dry, or invalid, for each [DE Africa Water Observation from Space Feature Layer](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Landsat_WOfS_specs.html#WOfS-Feature-Layer) scene that captured the water body. This can be used to identify when water bodies are increasing or decreasing in wet surface area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: DE Africa Waterbodies Surface Area Change measures the wet surface area of waterbodies as estimated from satellites. This product does not measure depth, volume, purpose of the waterbody, nor the source of the water.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications \n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify and analyse persistent and seasonal water bodies \n",
    "* Water resource management \n",
    "* Gain insights into the severity and spatial distribution of drought"
