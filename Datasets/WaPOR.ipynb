    "The **Wa**ter **P**roductivity through **O**pen access of **R**emotely sensed derived data (WaPOR) monitors and reports on agricultural water productivity through biophysical measures with a focus on Africa and the Near East. This information assists partner countries improve land and water productivity in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture ([Peiser et al. 2017](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/cdacf817-c13a-4859-b681-a4bdc20c065c)). \n",
