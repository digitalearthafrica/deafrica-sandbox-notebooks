### Proposed changes
Include a brief description of the changes being proposed, and why they are necessary.

### Checklist (replace `[ ]` with `[x]` to check off)
- [ ] Remove any unused Python packages from `Load packages`
- [ ] Remove any unused/empty code cells
- [ ] Remove any guidance cells (e.g. `General advice`)
- [ ] Ensure that all code cells follow the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. The `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool can be used to format code cells to a consistent style: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended)
- [ ] Include relevant tags in the first notebook cell and re-use tags if possible
- [ ] Ensure appropriate colour schemes  have been used to maximise accessibility for vision impairment. Test your images or learn more with [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) or [TPGI](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)
- [ ] Clear all outputs, run notebook from start to finish, and save the notebook in the state where all cells have been sequentially evaluated

### Closes issues (optional)
