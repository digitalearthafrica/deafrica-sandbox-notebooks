    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training data** is the most important part of any supervised machine learning workflow. The quality of the training data has a greater impact on the classification than the algorithm used. Large and accurate training data sets are preferable: increasing the training sample size results in increased classification accuracy ([Maxell et al 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2018.1433343)).  A review of training data methods in the context of Earth Observation is available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/6/1034) \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating training data, be sure to capture the **spectral variability** of the class, and to use imagery from the time period you want to classify (rather than relying on basemap composites). Another common problem with training data is **class imbalance**. This can occur when one of your classes is relatively rare and therefore the rare class will comprise a smaller proportion of the training set. When imbalanced data is used, it is common that the final classification will under-predict less abundant classes relative to their true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many platforms to use for gathering training data, the best one to use depends on your application. GIS platforms are great for collection training data as they are highly flexible and mature platforms; [Geo-Wiki](https://www.geo-wiki.org/) and [Collect Earth Online](https://collect.earth/home) are two open-source websites that may also be useful depending on the reference data strategy employed.\n",

To do this, we rely on a custom `deafrica-sandbox-notebooks` function called `collect_training_data`, contained within the [deafrica_classificationtools](../Scripts/deafrica_classificationtools.py) script.  The goal of this notebook is to familarise users with this function so they can extract the appropriate data for their use-case.\n",

If our data has a time-dimension (e.g. if we load in an annual time-series of satellite images) then we need to collapse the time dimension.  \"reduce_func\" is simply the summary statistic used to collapse the temporal dimension.
