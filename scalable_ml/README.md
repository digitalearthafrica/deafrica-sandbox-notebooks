# Scalable Supervised Machine Learning on the Open Data Cube

## Background
- The guiding principles/philosophy of the scripts (ie setting expectations around what they can and cannot do)
- The order to run the scripts in (including links to each script)
- Any prerequisites required to understand the content in these notebooks (e.g. reading material, ODC/Sandbox/notebooks/python training material)
- Information on any set-up that might be required to run these notebooks (e.g. creating folders for outputs? Setting up a S3 bucket for intermediate files?)


## Description

There are five notebooks in this collection which....


## Getting Started

To begin working through the notebooks in this `Scalable ML on the ODC` workflow, go to the first notebook `Extracting_training_data.ipynb`.
