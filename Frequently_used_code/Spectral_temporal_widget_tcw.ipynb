    "\n",
    "> * When adding **Products used**, embed the hyperlink to that specific product on the DE Africa Explorer using the `[product_name](product url)` syntax.\n",
    "> * When writing in Markdown cells, start each sentence on a **new line**.\n",
    "This makes it easy to see changes through git commits.\n",
    "> * To faciliate the easy conversion of these notebooks into a docs help page, check the [known issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-docs/wiki/Known-issues) for formatting regarding the conversion of notebooks to DE Africa docs using Sphinx.\n",
    "Things to be aware of:\n",
    "    * Sphinx is highly sensitive to bulleted lists:\n",
    "        * Ensure that there is an empty line between any preceding text and the list\n",
    "        * Only use the `*` bullet (`-` is not recognised)\n",
    "        * Sublists must be indented by 4 spaces\n",
    "    * Two kinds of formatting cannot be used simultaneously:\n",
    "        * Hyperlinked code: \\[\\`code_format\\`](hyperlink) fails\n",
    "        * Bolded code: \\*\\*\\`code_format\\`\\*\\* fails\n",
    "    * Headers must appear in hierachical order (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) and there can only be one title (`#`).\n",
    "> * Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "> * In the final notebook cell, include a set of relevant **keywords** which are used to build the DE Africa User Guide's [keyword Index](https://digital-earth-africa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genindex.html).\n",
    "    * Use the list of approved documentation keywords on the [wiki page](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki/List-of-Documentation-Keywords).\n",
    "    * Avoid using keywords that link to specific modules in `deafrica_tools`.\n",
    "    * Use all lower-case (unless the tag is an acronym), separate words with spaces\n",
    "    * Ensure the keywords cell below is in `Raw` format, rather than `Markdown` or `Code`.\n"

    "This notebook is an outcome of the ODC 2021 women sprint. \n",

    "Spectral-temporal features from time-series Earth observation data are often used to distinguish land cover types and monitor their evolution over time. They are particularly useful for understanding dynamic ecosystems such as wetlands.\n",
