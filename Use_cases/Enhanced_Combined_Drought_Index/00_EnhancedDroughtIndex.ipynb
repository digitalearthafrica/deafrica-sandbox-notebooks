    "Drought is an extended period, during which, fresh water availability and accessibility for the ecosystem at a given time and place is below normal, due to unfavourable spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, temperature, soil moisture and wind characteristics [(Balint et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-59559-1.00023-2). Severe droughts can affect large populations, leading to a long-term threat to people’s livelihoods and result in tremendous economic loss [(Enenkel et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8040340)."

    "The Enhanced Combined Drought(ECDI) Index aims at the timely and reliable detection of drought events with regard to their spatio-temporal extent and severity. The Enhanced Drought Index is a combination of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vegetation** component which considers NDVI deficits and deficit persistence. The index based on the vegetation component is named as **Vegetation Drought Index (VDI)**.\n",
    "- **Precipitation** component, which considers rainfall deficits and dryness persistence. The index calculated using the precipitation component is referred as the  **Precipitation Drought Index (PDI)**.\n",
    "- **Temperature** component, which considers temperature excesses and persistence of high temperatures. The index based on temperature is named as **Temperature Drought Index (TDI)**.\n",
    "- **Soil moisture** component, which considers soil moisture deficits and deficit persistence. The index based on soil moisture is named as the **Soil Moisture Drought Index (SMDI)**.\n",

    "The index uses **satellite-derived** rainfall, soil moisture, land surface temperature, and vegetation status as input datasets [(Enenkel et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8040340)"
