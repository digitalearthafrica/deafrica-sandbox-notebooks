# Use Cases

Notebooks in this collection are developed for specific use-cases of the Digital Earth Africa platform and may not run as seamlessly as notebooks in the other folders of this repository. Notebooks may contain less descriptive markdown, contain more complicated or bespoke analysis, and may take a long time to run. However, they contain useful analysis procedures and provide further examples for advanced users.
