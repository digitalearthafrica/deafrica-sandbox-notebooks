Use Cases
---------

These use cases are used by Digital Earth Africa to provide analyses to
decision makers for a particular area.

Notebooks in this collection are developed for specific use-cases of the
Digital Earth Africa platform and may not run as seamlessly as notebooks
in the other folders of this repository. Notebooks may contain less
descriptive markdown, contain more complicated or bespoke analysis, and
may take a long time to run. However, they contain useful analysis procedures
and provide further examples for advanced users.
