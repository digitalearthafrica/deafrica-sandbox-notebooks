    "## Background\n",
    "A \"datacube\" is a digital information architecture that specialises in hosting and cataloguing spatial information.\n",
    "[Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa)](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/) is based on the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) infrastructure, and specialises in storing remotely sensed data, particularly from Earth Observation satellites such as [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa datacube contains both raw satellite data and derivative data \"products\".\n",
    "These data products are often composed of a range of \"measurements\" such as the suite of remote sensing band values or statistical product summaries. Before running a query to load data from the datacube, it is useful to know what it contains.\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates several straightforward ways to inspect the product and measurement contents of a datacube."
