    "This notebook demonstrates how to conduct a basic analysis with DE Africa data and the Open Data Cube.\n",
    "It will combine many of the steps that have been covered in the other beginner's notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the analysis question is _\"How is the health of vegetation changing over time in a given area?\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be related to a number of broader questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the effect of a new land use practice on a field of crops?\n",
    "* How has a patch of forest changed after a fire? \n",
    "* How does proximity to water affect vegetation throughout the year?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, the analysis question will be kept simple, without much real-world context. \n",

    "1. Choosing a study area.\n",

    "3. Plotting the chosen data and exploring how it changes with time.\n",
