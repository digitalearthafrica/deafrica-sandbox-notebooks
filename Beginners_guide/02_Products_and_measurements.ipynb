    "A \"datacube\" is a digital information architecture that specialises in hosting and cataloguing spatial information.\n",
    "[Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa)](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/) is based on the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) infrastructure, and specialises in storing remotely sensed data, particularly from Earth Observation satellites such as [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and [Sentinel](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Overview4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Earth Africa datacube contains both raw satellite data and derivative data \"products\".\n",
